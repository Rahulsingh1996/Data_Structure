#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
Basic Mathematics.
The Pythagorean theorem is an important math concept that is applied everywhere in math and technology. The idea is simple in that a2 + b2 = c2 for a right angle triangle that has two sides, a and b, and a hypotenuse of c.
The Pythagorean Theorem and its many proofs. In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. There are several methods to prove the Pythagorean Theorem.

#### 3. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>
<div>
    The quizes are provided that will judge and inhance the skills of the Student.
    Each question is relevent to the experiment and just ment to increse the understanding of experiment and their concept.

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for Amplitude,Vmax,Vmin and will give Modulation index,and total power | This will test give the result of the experiment 
2.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student
