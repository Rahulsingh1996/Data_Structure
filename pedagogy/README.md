#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
Basic Mathematics.
<p>The Pythagorean theorem is an important math concept that is applied everywhere in math and technology. The idea is simple in that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> for a right angle triangle that has two sides, a and b, and a hypotenuse of c.
The Pythagorean Theorem and its many proofs. In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. There are several methods to prove the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

Pythagoras theorem states that “In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides“. The sides of this triangles have been named as Perpendicular, Base and Hypotenuse. Here, the hypotenuse is the longest side, as it is opposite to the angle 90°. The sides of a right triangle (say x, y and z) which has positive integer values, when squared are put into an equation, also called a Pythagorean triple.
<p><center>Hypotenuse<sup>2</sup> = Perpendicular<sup>2</sup> + Base<sup>2</sup> </center></p>
<p>c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><center>where, c is Hypotenuse b is Base and a is Hight.</center></p>

#### 3. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for Amplitude,Vmax,Vmin and will give Modulation index,and total power | This will test give the result of the experiment 
2.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student
