#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
Basic Mathematics.
<p>The Pythagorean theorem is an important math concept that is applied everywhere in math and technology. The idea is simple in that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> for a right angle triangle that has two sides, a and b, and a hypotenuse of c.
The Pythagorean Theorem and its many proofs. In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. There are several methods to prove the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

Pythagoras theorem states that “In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides“. The sides of this triangles have been named as Perpendicular, Base and Hypotenuse. Here, the hypotenuse is the longest side, as it is opposite to the angle 90°. The sides of a right triangle (say x, y and z) which has positive integer values, when squared are put into an equation, also called a Pythagorean triple.
<p><center>Hypotenuse<sup>2</sup> = Perpendicular<sup>2</sup> + Base<sup>2</sup> </center></p>
<p>c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><center>where, c is Hypotenuse b is Base and a is Hight.</center></p>

Sr.No | Learning Objective to be met | Tasks to be performed by the students | Assessment questions aligned to the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Calculate the sides | Take the individual value of <p>a²= c² - b²</p> b² = c² - a² <p>c² = a² + b²</p> | We should provide at least two value out of three sides of triangle and calculate value of remain one side.
2.| Analyze the importance of the Pythagoras theorem and understanding mathematical problems. | To find out the Height, Base and Hypotenuse. | Use the Simulation.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:

<br>1. Find a right angled triangle by giving base and heights in the input box.
<br>2. Find the respective three sides of a triangle.
<br>3. Pythagoras theorem is used to check if a given triangle is a right-angled triangle or not.
<br>4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to derive the equation of a circle.
<br>5. Use the area of right triangles to deduce the areas of other shapes.
<br>6. Use the Pythagorean Theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 to write an equation to be solved.
<br>7. Rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square. 
<br>8. Recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements.
<br>9. In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.
