                      <br><h4>Materials Required:</h4>
                      card board, colored pencils, pair of scissors, fevicol, geometry box.
                      <h4>Procedure:</h4>
               1. Take a card board of size say 20 cm Ã— 20 cm.
<br>2. Cut any right angled triangle and paste it on the cardboard. Suppose its sides are a, b and c.
<br>3. Cut a square of side a cm and place it along the side of length a cm of the right angled triangle.
<br>4. Similarly cut squares of sides b cm and c cm and place them along the respective sides of the right angled triangle.
Label the diagram as shown in Fig(a).
<br>5. Join BH and AI. These are two diagonals of the square ABIH. The two diagonals intersect each other at the point O.
Through O, draw RS || BC.
<br>6. Draw PQ, the perpendicular bisector of RS, passing through O.
<br>7. Now the square ABIH is divided in four quadrilaterals. Color them as shown in Fig(a) .
<br>8. From the square ABIH cut the four quadrilaterals. Color them and name them as shown in Fig(b).

<h4>As performed in the simulator:</h4>


1. Draw a right angled triangle by giving base and heights in the input box.
<br>2. Now, click on the respective three sides of a triangle.
<br>3. Now, click on the three squares to fill with distinct colors.
<br>4. Now, click on the base square to draw its diagonals.
<br>5. Now, click on hypotenuse to generate its parallel line.
<br>6. Now, drag the generated parallel line to the blue square so that it passes through the point of intersection of diagonals.
<br>7. Now, double click on this parallel line to generate its perpendicular bisector.
<br>8. Now, check all the check boxes in the tool box to get four quadrilaterals.
<br>9. Now, rearrange coloured pieces from the square below the base and the square along the height of the triangle, in the square along the hypotenuse.
 

<h4>Observation:</h4>                                                                  
<p>The square ACGF and the four quadrilaterals cut from the square ABIH completely fill the square BCED. Thus the theorem is verified.</p>
