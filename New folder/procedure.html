       	              <p><h3>As performed in the real lab:</h3></p>
                      <br><h4>Materials Required:</h4>
                      card board, colored pencils, pair of scissors, fevicol, geometry box.
                      <h4>Procedure:</h4>
               1. Take a card board of size say 20 cm Ã— 20 cm.
<br>2. Cut any right angled triangle and paste it on the cardboard. Suppose its sides are a, b and c.
<br>3. Cut a square of side a cm and place it along the side of length a cm of the right angled triangle.
<br>4. Similarly cut squares of sides b cm and c cm and place them along the respective sides of the right angled triangle.
Label the diagram as shown in Fig(a).
<br>5. Join BH and AI. These are two diagonals of the square ABIH. The two diagonals intersect each other at the point O.
Through O, draw RS || BC.
<br>6. Draw PQ, the perpendicular bisector of RS, passing through O.
<br>7. Now the square ABIH is divided in four quadrilaterals. Color them as shown in Fig(a) .
<br>8. From the square ABIH cut the four quadrilaterals. Color them and name them as shown in Fig(b).

<h4>As performed in the simulator:</h4>


1. Find a right angled triangle by giving base and heights in the input box.
<br>2. Find the respective three sides of a triangle.
<br>3. Pythagoras theorem is used to check if a given triangle is a right-angled triangle or not. 
<br>4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to derive the equation of a circle.
<br>5. Use the area of right triangles to deduce the areas of other shapes.
<br>6. Use the Pythagorean Theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 to write an equation to be solved.
<br>7.Rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square.
<br>8. Recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements.
<br>9.In a right triangle,the square of the hypotrnuse is eqal to the sum of the squareof the other two sides.
 

<h4>Observation:</h4>                                                                  
<p>The square ACGF and the four quadrilaterals cut from the square ABIH completely fill the square BCED. Thus the theorem is verified.</p>
