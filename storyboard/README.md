## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: To verify Pythagoras theorem by performing an activity.

### 1. Story Outline:

Pythagoras theorem states that “In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides“. The sides of this triangles have been named as Perpendicular, Base and Hypotenuse. Here, the hypotenuse is the longest side, as it is opposite to the angle 90°. The sides of a right triangle (say x, y and z) which has positive integer values, when squared are put into an equation, also called a Pythagorean triple.
### 2. Story:

Double sideband suppressed carrier modulation
At the beginning of the explanation of amplitude modulation, we explained the AM radio system, but the term for amplitude in the theoretical expression was complex. If the amplitude of the carrier wave is simply changed and mathematised, it is as follows. This modulation method is called DSB-SC (double sideband suppressed carrier modulation). As the name suggests, there’s no wave carrier in the modulated wave.

### 3. Set the Visual Stage Description:
The Pythagorean Theorem was one of the earliest theorems known to ancient civilizations. This famous theorem is named for the Greek mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras. Pythagoras founded the Pythagorean School of Mathematics in Cortona, a Greek seaport in Southern Italy. He is credited with many contributions to mathematics although some of them may have actually been the work of his students.

### 4. User objective goals
The Pythagorean Theorem is Pythagoras' most famous mathematical contribution. According to legend, Pythagoras was so happy when he discovered the theorem that he offered a sacrifice of oxen. The later discovery that the square root of 2 is irrational and therefore, cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, greatly troubled Pythagoras and his followers. They were devout in their belief that any two lengths were integral multiples of some unit length. Many attempts were made to suppress the knowledge that the square root of 2 is irrational. It is even said that the man who divulged the secret was drowned at sea.
