<b>1. Why Red-black trees are preferred over hash tables though hash tables have constant time complexity?</b>
<br> a : No they are not preferred.
<br> b : because of resizing issues of hash table and better ordering in redblack trees.
 <br>c : because they can be implemented using trees.
<br> d : because they are balanced
<br><b>2. How can you save memory when storing color information in Red-Black tree?</b>
<br> a : using least significant bit of one of the pointers in the node for color information
 <br>b : using another array with colors of each node
<br> c : storing color information in the node structure
 <br>d : using negative and positive numbering
<br><b>3. Find the RED/BLACK TREE, arry Insert 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7</b>
